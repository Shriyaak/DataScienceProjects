## Useful information

Data folder should be in the same location as the notebook.ipyb

### Data collection procedure

https://phyphox.org app

Data to collect: Acceleration (without g)

1. Moving your phone in a circle
2. Waving
3. Gesturing “come here”
4. Gesturing “go away”

Do each gesture continuously for 15 repetitions (without stopping). Make 8 to 10 sets

### Some notes for data collecting:

- Please export using CSV (Comma, decimal point)
- It is much easier to do the remote access as you can download straight to your laptop/pc
- Please place your raw zip folders inside data/{gesture}/unprocessed and then run /utils/process_zips.py to process the raw files
